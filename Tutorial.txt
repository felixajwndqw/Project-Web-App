Annotating:
--------------

Draw shapes to mark important features of the image:
 - The bulge of a galaxy can be marked with a circle. Sometimes there may be more than one!
 - Use lines to mark a galaxy's spiral arms from the bulge to the end of the arm.
 - Use an ellipse or circle to outline the boundary of the galaxy.
 - If you can spot a rare out of the ordinary feature such as a ring or an irregular galaxy, use your best judgement and try to make it with a shape you think is appropriate.
