                        The Zooniverse is the world’s largest and most popular platform for people-powered research.
                        This research is made possible by volunteers — hundreds of thousands of people around the world
                        who come together to assist professional researchers. Our goal is to enable research that would
                        not be possible, or practical, otherwise. Zooniverse research results in new discoveries,
                        datasets useful to the wider research community, and many publications.

                    <q>
                        The major challenge of 21st century research is dealing with the flood of information we can now
                        collect about the world around us. Computers can help, but in many fields the human ability for
                        pattern recognition — and our ability to be surprised — makes us superior. With the help of Zooniverse
                        volunteers, researchers can analyze their information more quickly and accurately than would otherwise
                        be possible, saving time and resources, advancing the ability of computers to do the same tasks, and
                        leading to faster progress and understanding of the world, getting to exciting results more quickly.

                        our job is very simple! All you need to do is look out for the features that mark out spiral and
                        elliptical galaxies. In fact, as you're a human and not a computer, most galaxies should be easy to
                        classify since they're obviously spirals or obviously ellipticals. On this page, you will practice
                        classifying galaxies. On the next page, you will take a short trial to test your skills.
                        If you don’t pass the trial, you can try again. Once you pass the trial, you can start contributing to
                        Galaxy Zoo science!
